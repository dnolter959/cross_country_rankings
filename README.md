# cross_country_rankings

This is a project that I began a while back and have not completed. 

### Motivation, Goal, Backgroud

- I started running competitively when I was in 8th grade, and it has been an enormous part of my life since then. I ran cross country and track in high school and college at the Universtiy of Rochester. 
- As far as sports go, cross country is about as simple as it gets. 
  - Everyone runs the race, and, once the race is over, each participant gets a "score" that simply corresponds to the place in which they finished.  
  - Each team has 7 runners, but only 5 of them score. To get a team score, just add up the scores for each team's 5 scoring runners.
  - The team with the lowest score wins.
-  Cross country is relativlely "data rich"; I would like to use this data to build a mode, which predict the results of NCAA championships at end the each season

### What have I done so far 
- I am working in R
- Built a process for scraping data from https://www.tfrrs.org/, and repository of all NCAA cross country and track results
- Built a process to store data for a given race into a local SQL database
